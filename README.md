# Fatal Police Shootings (2015-2024)
In this project, I use SQL and Tableau to explore the Washington Post's Fatal Force Database. Starting in 2015, the Washington Post began tracking every person shot and killed by the police. Demographic analysis reveals that the majority of victims are young (between 20-40 years), overwhelmingly male, and that Native and Black Americans are killed at disproportionate rates. I also analyze time trends, seasonality, body camera utilization, involvement of weapons, and produce a map displaying the geographic distribution of fatal shootings.
